				<p>	We are Escape Rooms. We dedicate our time to provide entertainment to people of various ages and backgrounds. In our escape rooms you will be submerged into another reality, you will have the chance to test your fear tolerance, and to challenge your creativity and patience. At the moment we operate only three rooms, each has a different theme, but in the future we hope to broaden our selection and open new points across Dublin.

				<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji2">2. What are escape rooms?</button>
				<div id="emoji2" class="collapse">
					<p>
					Escape rooms are little adventures, whole other lives experienced in one hour. Behind the door of each of them you will find an immersive story, where you will be the protagonist. Once you start the game, first you will be given a brief that changes in relation to what exact game you booked. Once the gamemaster explains the story, they lead you behind the door of the playing room itself, and lock you in. Inside, you will find an elaborately designed space, where you have to solve riddles using different kinds of tools to progress and eventually get out of the room. Bring your friends and co-workers to this adventure, and you will certainly learn a lot of new things about yourselves.

			<div class="accordion-item" id="question3">
			<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji3">3. Are there any rules?</button>
	<div id="emoji3" class="collapse">


					<p>
					There are a few rules to the game: do not break any equipment, do not touch or use objects above the blue line (drawn on the walls), listen carefully to gamemaster’s brief and please enjoy the adventure :)
				</p>

			<div class="accordion-item" id="question4">
			<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji4">4. How do I pay?</button>
	<div id="emoji4" class="collapse">

					<p>
					Once you are inside the room, you can use all the tools lying around to solve the riddles unless specified otherwise. Listen carefully to the brief, use creative thinking, and you will find a solution. If you feel stuck, you can always ask for a hint with the gamemaster through a big button near the entrance door. They will be watching your progress on cameras, too. When you are done and you “escape”, we will congratulate you on success, make a photo for our gallery and give you a bracelet to remember us.

			<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji5">5. Do I need any special equipment to play?</button>
	<div id="emoji5" class="collapse">

					<p>
					You do not need anything special to participate in the escape room adventure. For the quest with actors make sure you have comfortable footwear.

			<div class="accordion-item" id="question6">
				<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji6">6. Are there any restrictions on what I can do in the rooms?</button>
	<div id="emoji6" class="collapse">

					<p>
					As specified before, please do not break any on the objects inside the rooms, and do not use anything above the blue line on the wall. These are unplayable objects.
				</p>
				</div>

			<div class="accordion-item" id="question7">
			<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji7">7. What are actors doing in the rooms?</button>
	<div id="emoji7" class="collapse">

					<p>
					At the moment we only have one quest that includes actor interaction, “The Mental Hospital”. Before the game you choose what level of contact you want (no-medium-hard), and according to that actors play their roles. They may scare, chase and even grab you, but what exactly will happen depends on your own preferences.

			<div class="accordion-item" id="question8">
			<button class="fun" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#emoji8">8. Can I play just one room?</button>
	<div id="emoji8" class="collapse">

					<p>
					You can play only one room, or all of them, it does not affect your success or failure. However, if you play through all the games in order, you will get a secret bonus :)
